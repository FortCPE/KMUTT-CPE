## Instruction
Read [instruction.pdf](instruction.pdf)

## Guide
This lab is uses HBase, I recommended to Hbase on Docker so you don't need to install it on your machine.
Use `harisekhon/hbase` image. 
Only one command you will have Hbase and get access to Hbase shell
```bash
docker run -ti harisekhon/hbase
```
VSCode recommend to use Perl syntax highlight
. VSCode theme `Quiet Light`
